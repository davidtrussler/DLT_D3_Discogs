This is an excercise in the use of D3 based on the Discogs API (https://www.discogs.com/developers/).

The aim is to use the API to collect data based on my record collection and display that in various (hopefully interesting) ways.

The first such visualisation is a bar chart of the categories in my collection:

Moving on then to a pie chart visualisation of the same data.
